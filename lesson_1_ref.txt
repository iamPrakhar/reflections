diff can be used to compare different files.
It gives the position where difference between the 2 files which are compared 
exists.

When u have easy access to the history of the file it can be pretty helpful in 
viewing what all changes have been made to the file.

One commit per logical change


Difference between auto  commit ex:google docs and manual commit??
Auto commit u dont know what time the commit ll happen 
Manual is good but it should be done by taking in to consideration "ONE commit
per logical changE.


Project has several files related to each other for proper functioning of the 
project. A collection of files is called a "REPOSITORY" in git,
whenever a commit is made to a file in a project revision is made to all the 
files in that project for proper functioning of that project.




git config --global color.ui auto

Using git log and git diff??
git log gives the history of all the commit that were made to a file and gives a unique commit id,
git diff is used to compare to files and its format is git diff commit_id1 commit_id2.

git init: creates a repo
